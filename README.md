# Welcome to BandMap
### A way to explore Bandcamp on a map.

On BandMap, each circle represents a city. The more artists there are in the city, the bigger the circle. Hovering over a city will let you know how many artists there are and which genres are most popular to make in that city (not based on listener habits).

In the Info tab you will find more details on what the menu buttons do. Go to options to filter which kinds of artists populate the map, and choose the style of the map.

As of now, the app lives on [Heroku]('https://bandmap-v1.herokuapp.com/). It cannot be run locally since the database and Spotify Dev credetentials are not provided. If you'd like to become a contributor, feel free to reach out.
